In this project, We are building a clone of the popular platform, AirBnB. Our goal is to create a command-line interface (CLI) that will serve as a command interpreter for managing objects and their abstraction, as well as handling their storage.

This is the first phase of AirBnB project, to create a basic clone of the AirBnB web app. In this first phase a basic console was created using the Cmd Python module, to manage the objects of the whole project, being able to implement the methods create, show, update, all, and destroy to the existing classes and subclasses.
